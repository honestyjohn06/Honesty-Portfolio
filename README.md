a. The dimensions i used for each viewport is as follows:



-Phone - max 480px ---> Most phones only go upto 480 px, this ensures that the webpage flows well and the text and elements are still readable

-Tablet - min 481px, max 960px ---> Most tables fall within this range, and the goal was to allow for 2 columns, however website will stack if needed

-Desktop - min 961px - desktops and laptops usually have screens about 961px, which allowed for multi-column layouts, more spacing and bigger images.



b.I used a linear gradient on my Projects page behind the project description boxes and the title box, as well as behind the Contact Me form. I felt these pages looked flat and lacked character. The linear gradient added visual interest and depth to the otherwise plain sections. It also helped create a more cohesive and polished look, following the website’s overall color scheme.



c. [*Color scheme*](https://colorhunt.co/palette/1b262c0f4c753282b8bbe1fa) - #1B262C #0F4C75 #3282B8 #BBE1FA

I used a thematic blue color scheme for my website because the dark blue background gives off a professional feel, which is important for a portfolio, and helps the other colors stand out. The mid-tone blues evoke feelings of trust and stability and serve as the base colors for the website. The bright blue is meant to draw attention, so it’s used on elements where I want the user to click or focus, like the “Let’s Talk” button.
